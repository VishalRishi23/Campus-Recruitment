# Campus-Recruitment
This project aims to find the most deterministic features of salary and placement status of students in an institute. We perform linear and logitic regression to analyse the feature importance. We also perform Exploratory Data Analysis using the package Sweetviz. The HTML report is attached. In the process, we were able to conclude that the analysis requires even stronger features to completely explain the distribution of salary (R-squared = 0.14). The logistic regression model was able to provide an f1-score around 87%
